BUGS
----

OOTB behaviour/appearance should match the built-in card:
  - check colour settings
    - the battery-grid line colour is unclear: Oct 19 shows blue here but purple in HASS
      - might the colour be based on the flow values rather than the grid-import/export totals?

Investigate why two dot radii are needed - one for the main flows and one for the low-carbon/gas/etc!

The 'multi entity' picker is sizing itself to the full width of its entity's name, should be constrained
  - HASS bug

Reinstate the -ve coords for the lines, they are required so that the dots don't just vanish!
  - and presumably they should extend at both ends?

Power-outage is calculating its state up-front, rather than live as-needed (see GridState)




FEATURES
--------

More modes:
    - current month
    - current year
    - perhaps a user-supplied date-range?
  - could display this as a title?

If data is still loading when we render, go ahead and render the circles/lines anyway, just put 'loading' for the values

Bigger circles!
  - possibly dynamic if something can be figured out?

Display the flow rates as hover-overs on the lines
  Or over the circles?

Might need to support a vertical layout
  - either dynamic, based on available width and the number of Nodes to draw, or user-controlled
  - basically rotate right by 90




GENERAL
-------

README and CHANGELOG updates

Rename to 'Energy Distribution Extended' (energy-distribution-ext) for consistency with the built-in card

Test localisation by disabling EN and EN-GB and checking that all strings revert to their keys
  - also check that there aren't any redundant keys!


 - for the Home node, perhaps have the option to show Gas and Electric as separate figures?
    - this would allow the Gas to be added to the circle without it overpowering the value
    - could even display all three figures, if the circle were made larger
    - producing devices are expected to be electric, not gas, so they won't be a problem
    - each value will require an icon (same idea as the secondaries, use the icons from Grid/Gas)
    - the 'include in calculation' could be moved onto Home, rather than being per-device
        - separate options for 'electric' and 'gas'?
            - 'electric' is probably just whether to include Devices
            - 'gas' would be 'hidden', 'displayed', 'include in total'...or something

 May be able to remove pruneConfig() now

 See if the 'state' values in the State objects can be made internal/private - they should not be accessed outside the EntityStates object
