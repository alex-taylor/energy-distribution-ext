TODO
----

Code:
  - add support for Power
    - single-entities for Grid/Battery/Devices
    - no stats-gathering, just sensors
    - sensor types are now Power and Measurement
    - support State-of-Charge for Battery
    - see what else should be changed/hidden
  - rename to 'Energy Distribution Extended' (energy-distribution-ext) for consistency with the built-in card
    - or something else, given Power support as well
  - power-outage is calculating its state up-front, rather than live as-needed (see GridState)
    - also needs implementing in the new grid render method
  - unit-testing
  - move the language files to Typescript so enum values can be used for the keys
  - dynamic labelling for, eg, Battery's import ('discharge') and export ('charge') fields in the UI

Interaction:
  - clicking on the low-carbon circle should do the same as the HASS card

Display:
  - bigger circles!
    - possibly dynamic if something can be figured out?
    - need a Layout class to hold the calculated sizes
  - if data is still loading when we render, go ahead and render the circles/lines anyway, just put 'loading' for the values (or an overlay in the centre of the card?)
  - Flows:
    - in non-HASS mode, see if the grid->home flow can be made to alternate between high and low carbon colours on successive runs
      - ideally in proportion, but otherwise a simple 1:1 will do
      - can animation do this?
      - similarly, the grid-import ring can now show high and low
  - Home:
    - include producing devices in the segment arrays
    - if 'subtract' is set, subtract consuming devices from the appropriate total
  - Devices:
    - first attempt to expand to the right
    - if there is not enough space for the required number of columns, expand below instead
    - for rightwards, draw the bus out from the Home circle and position devices above/below it
      - could try to get clever and stop the bus one column from the end so we can fit three devices in a column
    - for downwards, draw the bus from the bottom of the Home circle, then turn left to the centre column and then downwards
      - this occpuies the first 'row' below the standard 3x3 grid (or 3x2 if no battery is present)
      - devices now go to the left/right of the bus
        - and again, the bottom-most row could contain three devices


Under consideration
-------------------

  - more modes:
    - current month
    - current year
    - perhaps a user-supplied date-range?
    - could display this as a title?
  - display the flow rates as hover-overs on the lines
    - or over the circles?
    - or do we bother?  the segments may be enough now
  - may be able to remove pruneConfig() now
    - but see if it can be used to filter out 'bad' config rather than forcing the user into YAML mode
      - or failing that - is there any way to find out from validation what the bad config is so we can at least *tell* the user?
        - looks like it - see superstruct
  - see if the 'state' values in the State objects can be made internal/private - they should not be accessed outside the EntityStates object
    - probably not, they'd have to be instance fields on EntityStates
  - alternative flow algorithm which prioritises House->Battery->Grid



Before release
--------------

  - README and CHANGELOG updates
  - add license
  - test dashboard link
  - test localisation by disabling EN and checking that all strings revert to their keys
    - also check that there aren't any redundant keys!
      - if all keys are enums, this should be simple
  - find out why there seems to be a serious delay in populating the display after setting the date or changing the config
