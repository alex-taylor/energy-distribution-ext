BUGS
----

Layout:
  - find out about setting a min width
  - insert spacers between columns

Clicking on the low-carbon circle should do the same as the HASS card

Battery: if either Import or Export is missing, this should be treated as a warning

The 'multi entity' picker is sizing itself to the full width of its entity's name, should be constrained
  - HASS bug

Power-outage is calculating its state up-front, rather than live as-needed (see GridState)
  - also needs implementing in the new grid render method

If there are no exports to a Node, don't display its export state
  - logically, the export should be excluded from the flow calcs, too

If there are no imports from a Node, don't display its import state
  - logically, the import should be excluded from the flow calcs, too

If the circle size is set larger, we can spill off the side of the card - what is HASS using as the card's min-width here?
  - should we resize the circles dynamically as the card shrinks?




FEATURES
--------

Make the colour of the grid->home line and dot either larger-value or (for the line) dashed by proportion of high/low-carbon

More modes:
    - current month
    - current year
    - perhaps a user-supplied date-range?
  - could display this as a title?

If data is still loading when we render, go ahead and render the circles/lines anyway, just put 'loading' for the values

Bigger circles!
  - possibly dynamic if something can be figured out?

Display the flow rates as hover-overs on the lines
  Or over the circles?

Might need to support a vertical layout
  - either dynamic, based on available width and the number of Nodes to draw, or user-controlled
  - basically rotate right by 90




GENERAL
-------

Linear/log scale flag in Appearance
'Gas' option in Home: 'Do not show', 'Single ring', 'Dual ring', 'Split ring'
'Electric devices' flag in Home
For the dual-value nodes, add 'Dual' and 'Split' options

README and CHANGELOG updates

Add license

Rename to 'Energy Distribution Extended' (energy-distribution-ext) for consistency with the built-in card

 - for the Home node, perhaps have the option to show Gas and Electric as separate figures?
    - this would allow the Gas to be added to the circle without it overpowering the value
    - could even display all three figures, if the circle were made larger
    - producing devices are expected to be electric, not gas, so they won't be a problem
    - each value will require an icon (same idea as the secondaries, use the icons from Grid/Gas)
    - the 'include in calculation' could be moved onto Home, rather than being per-device
        - separate options for 'electric' and 'gas'?
            - 'electric' is probably just whether to include Devices
            - 'gas' would be 'hidden', 'displayed', 'include in total'...or something

 May be able to remove pruneConfig() now

 See if the 'state' values in the State objects can be made internal/private - they should not be accessed outside the EntityStates object




 TEST
 ----
  - dashboard link

  - Test localisation by disabling EN and EN-GB and checking that all strings revert to their keys
    - also check that there aren't any redundant keys!
