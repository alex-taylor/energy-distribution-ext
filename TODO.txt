TODO
----

Code:
  - add support for Power
    - single-entities for Grid/Battery/Devices
    - no stats-gathering, just sensors
    - sensor types are now Power and Measurement
    - support State-of-Charge for Battery
    - see what else should be changed/hidden
  - rename to 'Energy Distribution Extended' (energy-distribution-ext) for consistency with the built-in card
    - or something else, given Power support as well
  - power-outage is calculating its state up-front, rather than live as-needed (see GridState)
    - also needs implementing in the new grid render method
  - unit-testing
  - move the language files to Typescript so enum values can be used for the keys
  - dynamic labelling for, eg, Battery's import ('discharge') and export ('charge') fields in the UI
  - support entities in cal and J as well as Wh, for compatibility with HASS
    - gas also supports volumes
      - needs the calorific value to be supplied by the user
        - support a sensor as well as a value?
    - all energy values are converted to the same units, whatever that is
      - in the case of a volume sensor for gas, while we do the conversion so that flow calcs will work we also store the actual value for display in that node if the user selects to do so
        - which is to say that the value will be converted to the user's selected units, so if they picked an energy unit rather than a volume unit we either don't store or else convert to m3
  - see if a generic 'get enum values for UI' function can be written
    - params would be the name (or type) of the enum, and an optional list of the values wanted
      - if no values are specified, it returns all values in the order they are defined

Interaction:
  - clicking on the low-carbon circle should do the same as the HASS card

Config:
  - is it possible to auto-detect changes to the Energy config?
      - either way, we could have a button on the main page to (re)load the entities from that config
  - Secondaries:
    - drop threshold
    - if the selected entity is Energy, hide the 'show units', 'override units' and 'display precision' options, since these will be ignored
    - need a helptext for 'override units', 'display precision' to explain what happens if set/not set

Display:
  - Energy Units:
    - support display in J and cal as well as Wh
      - for Gas, support 'same as electric', plus suitable volume units
  - if data is still loading when we render, go ahead and render the diagram anyway, just put 'loading' for the values (or an overlay in the centre of the card?)
  - Flows:
    - in non-HASS mode, see if the grid->home flow can be made to alternate between high and low carbon colours on successive runs
      - ideally in proportion, but otherwise a simple 1:1 will do
      - can animation do this?
      - similarly, the grid-import ring can now show high and low
    - fix z-ordering so that dots appear on top of lines
    - go back to specifying direction:
        - this will fix the alignment and overlap problems with the dashed line, and will help when doing bi-directional devices
  - Home:
    - include producing devices in the segment arrays
    - if 'subtract' is set, subtract consuming devices from the appropriate total
  - Low-carbon:
    - change value display to support energy/percentage/both options
  - Devices:
    - see if the Energy Dashboard's devices can be detected and loaded
    - first attempt to expand to the right
    - if there is not enough space for the required number of columns, expand below instead
    - for rightwards, draw the bus out from the Home circle and position devices above/below it
      - could try to get clever and stop the bus one column from the end so we can fit three devices in a column
    - for downwards, draw the bus from the bottom of the Home circle, then turn left to the centre column and then downwards
      - this occpuies the first 'row' below the standard 3x3 grid (or 3x2 if no battery is present)
      - devices now go to the left/right of the bus
        - and again, the bottom-most row could contain three devices


Under consideration
-------------------

  - more modes:
    - current month
    - current year
    - perhaps a user-supplied date-range?
    - could display this as a title?
  - display the flow rates as hover-overs on the lines
    - or over the circles?
    - or do we bother?  the segments may be enough now
  - may be able to remove pruneConfig() now
    - but see if it can be used to filter out 'bad' config rather than forcing the user into YAML mode
      - or failing that - is there any way to find out from validation what the bad config is so we can at least *tell* the user?
        - looks like it - see superstruct
  - see if the 'state' values in the State objects can be made internal/private - they should not be accessed outside the EntityStates object
    - probably not, they'd have to be instance fields on EntityStates
  - alternative flow algorithm which prioritises House->Battery->Grid
    - implementation:
      - define consts/enum for the four nodes: House, Grid, Battery, Solar
      - define arrays of 'producer order' and 'consumer order': these use the consts
      - inside the flow-calculation:
        - use the five supplied values plus the calculated 'to house' value to populate an array of nodes, where each entry is a tuple{producer,consumer} using 'undefined' where appropriate
        - iterate over the selected 'producer order' array
          - for each producer, iterate over the 'consumer order' array, skipping where producer==consumer
          - calculate the producer->consumer flow value at this point and increment the corresponding entry in a 2d-array, where the first index is the 'producer' and the second the 'consumer'
        - finally, pull the values out of the 2d-array and populate the Flows object as normal
      - check whether this actually matches how the HASS algo works!
        - might, for example, need per-producer 'consumer order' arrays rather than a single one
      - the arrays are selected based on the config, eg:
        - for HASS the 'producer' might be [Solar,Battery,Grid] and 'consumer' [Battery,Grid,House]
        - whereas for a more realistic approach the 'consumer' would be [House,Battery,Grid]
        - we can give the user some degree of control here if/as required, but the basic algo should cope with any setup



Before release
--------------

  - README and CHANGELOG updates
  - add license
  - test dashboard link
  - test localisation by disabling EN and checking that all strings revert to their keys
    - also check that there aren't any redundant keys!
      - if all keys are enums, this should be simple
  - find out why there seems to be a serious delay in populating the display after setting the date or changing the config
    - apparently receiving each data-set (primary and secondary) twice per card
