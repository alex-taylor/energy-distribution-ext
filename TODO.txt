TODO
----

Card:
  - add support for Power
    - new 'mode' option: 'Energy' / 'Power'
    - single-entities for Grid/Battery/Devices
    - no stats-gathering, just sensors
    - sensor types are now Power and Measurement
    - support State-of-Charge for Battery
      - this could be done using the secondary, although then we'd need to know that it was a SoC in order to manage the main icon
        - we could check its device_class: if "battery" then it's a SoC
    - see what else should be changed/hidden
  - layout:
    - draw three devices in the last column/row to save space
    - 'spread' the lines going into Home:
      - start at centre-FLOW_LINE_SPACING, and then move in by increments where the increment is FLOW_LINE_SPACING/(numDevices/2)
  - BUG: clicking on the low-carbon secondary opens both the entity viewer and the map...
  - BUG: in 'dimmed' mode, the paths are noticeably brighter than the node circles!
  - BUG: the dots are being rendered at the (0,0) of the lines panel
    - may now be fixed?
  - BUG: the 'Loading' message appears over a very short card, looks like while the lines are being rendered the nodes are not
    - may now be fixed?

Editor:
  - dynamic labelling for, eg, Battery's import ('discharge') and export ('charge') fields in the UI
    - also for Devices, where 'export' ('consumption') and 'import' ('production') will be confusing!
      - and the main colours should be 'Flow'
    - it's too much work to change the underlying config fields, so this is strictly a cosmetic thing in the UK
  - refactor out the dropdown options lists, there's a lot of duplication going on!
  - BUG: Devices page-link not showing its status-icon
  - BUG: both Grid and Gas are reporting a missing entity on the editor page when a secondary is present



Under consideration
-------------------

  - may be able to remove pruneConfig() now
    - or not: if 'overrides' is cleared, you get an empty object in the config...
    - but see if it can be used to filter out 'bad' config rather than forcing the user into YAML mode
      - or failing that - is there any way to find out from validation what the bad config is so we can at least *tell* the user?
        - looks like it - see superstruct
  - alternative flow algorithm which prioritises House->Battery->Grid
    - implementation:
      - define consts/enum for the four nodes: House, Grid, Battery, Solar
      - define arrays of 'producer order' and 'consumer order': these use the consts
      - inside the flow-calculation:
        - use the five supplied values plus the calculated 'to house' value to populate an array of nodes, where each entry is a tuple{producer,consumer} using 'undefined' where appropriate
        - iterate over the selected 'producer order' array
          - for each producer, iterate over the 'consumer order' array, skipping where producer==consumer
          - calculate the producer->consumer flow value at this point and increment the corresponding entry in a 2d-array, where the first index is the 'producer' and the second the 'consumer'
        - finally, pull the values out of the 2d-array and populate the Flows object as normal
      - check whether this actually matches how the HASS algo works!
        - might, for example, need per-producer 'consumer order' arrays rather than a single one
      - the arrays are selected based on the config, eg:
        - for HASS the 'producer' might be [Solar,Battery,Grid] and 'consumer' [Battery,Grid,House]
        - whereas for a more realistic approach the 'consumer' would be [House,Battery,Grid]
        - we can give the user some degree of control here if/as required, but the basic algo should cope with any setup
  - redesign the render code so that it's static, only refreshing on a config/layout change, and the states/css/etc are poked into it on a data-update


Before release
--------------

  - rename to 'Energy Distribution Extended' (energy-distribution-ext) for consistency with the built-in card
    - or something else, given Power support as well
  - look into better default colours for devices which work in both light and dark modes
  - README and CHANGELOG updates
  - unit-testing
  - add license
  - reinstate terser in rollup.config.js
  - check against the Plus cards for missing/broken functionality
  - check against the Plus issue-lists for features which might be worth adding
